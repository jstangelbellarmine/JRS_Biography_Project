        <p>Born and raised in Indiana, I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to study abroad due to a few scholarships
            I received. From <strong>Spain</strong> to <em>Peru</em>, I honed my Spanish and went into a teacher-certification 
            program after completing my undergraduate. I spent 12-years teaching in central Indiana and 
            moved to Chicago in 2021 to puruse better job prospects. During my summers, I spend time in Indianapolis
            at All-American Gardens, a nonprofit I founded in 2015.
